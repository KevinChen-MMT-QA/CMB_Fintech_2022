# CMB_Fintech_2022
A LGBoost-based solution for CMB-Fintech Contest 2022.

In this contest, we need to design a model to predict customer defection rate. Given datasets containing transaction records, our goal is to predict the probability of customers taking out their deposits after three months.

The model's evaluation metric is AUC.
